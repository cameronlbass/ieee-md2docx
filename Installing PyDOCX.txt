To install the
python-docx module on Lubuntu 22, you primarily use the pip package manager for Python 3. The following steps will guide you through the process in the terminal: 
1. Update package lists
It's always good practice to update your local package lists before installing new software. Open your terminal and run:

bash
```
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Ensure Python 3 and Pip are installed 
Lubuntu 22 should have Python 3 pre-installed. Verify this and install python3-pip if you don't have it already: 

bash
```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

You can verify the Python version with python3 --version. 
3. Install the python-docx module 
Use pip3 to install the package. It's recommended to install packages for your local user to avoid potential permission issues or conflicts with system packages: 

bash
```
pip3 install python-docx --user
```

pip will automatically handle the installation of dependencies, such as lxml, which python-docx requires. 
Alternatively, you can install it globally for all users using sudo: 

bash
```
sudo pip3 install python-docx
```

Note: Using sudo with pip is generally discouraged unless necessary; the --user method is safer. 
4. Verify the installation
You can check if the module was installed correctly by running a simple Python command in your terminal: 

bash
```
python3 -c "import docx; print(docx.__version__)"
```

If the command runs without an ModuleNotFoundError, the installation was successful. It may print the installed version number or, if not configured to print the version, simply complete without error. 
5. Troubleshooting: ModuleNotFoundError
If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError after installation, it's likely that your Python interpreter isn't looking in the directory where pip installed the module. 

    Check the installation path: You can find the installation location using pip show python-docx.
    Use a virtual environment: To avoid path issues, consider using a virtual environment. This creates an isolated Python environment for your projects. You can learn more about managing environments in the official Python documentation.
